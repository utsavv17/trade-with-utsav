          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <h4 class="intro">I'm Utsav, a Multi Asset Trader and Portfolio Manager.
            I've been trading for 2 years now and want people to see the world of Stock Market through my eyes as a means to earn rather than seeing it as a place to gamble. 
            It's my process and approach towards day and swing trading that will help you get better and make a career in this field. I learnt markets the hard way facing ups and downs along my journey. 
            I am here to cut the years it takes for you to become a profitable trader and reach my level and even beyond. This is my personal ambition to help others because I was alone in my journey.</h4>

            <h3>Strangle</h3>
            <p>A strangle strategy is similar to a straddle as both rely on the volatility of the market. It is also made with the purchase of a call and put option. However, a strangle cost less than a straddle. This is because the put option has a lower strike price and the call option has a higher strike price.</p>

            <h3>Straddle</h3>
            <p> Investors use the straddle strategy when they believe the price of the underlying asset will be volatile. This is made with a call and put option with the same strike price. If premiums are not considered,  then investors will receive a profit if the spot price is either bigger or smaller than the strike price..</p>

            <h3>Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST)</h3>
            <p>BTST (Buy Today Sell Tomorrow) trading is Short-term trading where traders take advantage of short-term fluctuations in share prices.

            <h3>Calendar spreads</h3>
            <p> A calendar spread is an options or futures strategy established by simultaneously entering a long and short position on the same underlying asset but with different delivery dates. In a typical calendar spread, one would buy a longer-term contract and go short a nearer-term option with the same strike price.</p>
